# AkkaConcurrencyIssueTest
This is a demo project to show how actor can run into Concurrency Issues if not properly handled(for a very specific scenario alone)


Run the Test cases `ActorOneTest` & `ActorTwoTest` in any IDE for the details test messages since the JUnit is written in a different way where TestCase passing/failing is enitrely handled manually and printed the same in the console. If Tests are run in Terminal, then it will simply show as All Tests are passed at the end without any intermediary manualy printed messages/logs. So depend on the JUnit result, instead look into the logs/messages printed in the Console.
